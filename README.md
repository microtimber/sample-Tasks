**This is a fork of the main [NativeScript tasks sample](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Tasks) that you can run from the NativeScript CLI.**
How to run:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/microtimber/sample-Tasks.git
$ cd sample-task
$ tns platform add android
$ tns run android
```
But whichever emulator or device, Tasks app can't run:
***Unfortunately, Tasks has stopped***

Open source cross-platform Tasks app built with NativeScript.

Use this application to find-out how to implement common mobile scenarios with NativeScript.

**Scenario**

We chose an app that we know will cover a lot of useful scenarios:

1. User management
  1. User authentication
  2. User registration
  3. User welcome email

2. Cloud data 
  1. read, update, delete and create data entry stored in the cloud
  2. Offline support for the data (not in this article, but coming soon)

3. Modern UX
  1. Using SideBar
  2. Pull to Refresh
  3. FAB (floating action button for Android Lollipop)
  4. Load on demand for many tasks

4. Device integration
  1. using camera
  2. using phone contacts

5. Patterns/Technologies used
  1. MVVM 
  2. CSS for styling
  3. XML and data-binding for describing the UI
  4. Platform specific targeting for the Android FAB button       
  5. 3rd party native libraries to load Telerik UI
